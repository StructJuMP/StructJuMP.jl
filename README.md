# StructJuMP
The StructJuMP package provides a parallel algebraic modeling framework for block structured optimization models in Julia. StructJuMP, originally known as StochJuMP, is tailored to two-stage stochastic optimization problems and uses MPI to enable a parallel, distributed memory instantiation of the problem. StructJuMP.jl is an extension of the [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) package, which is as fast as [AMPL](http://ampl.com) and faster than any other modeling tools such as [GAMS](http://www.gams.com) and [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org) (see [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1431.pdf)).


##Nonlinear solvers for StructJuMP
Problems modeled in StructJuMP models can be solved in parallel using [PIPS-NLP](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/PIPS) parallel optimization solver. In addition, StructJuMP models can be solved (in serial only) using [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt). The solver interface and glue code  for PIPS-NLP and Ipopt are located at [StructJuMPSolverInterface](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/StructJuMPSolverInterface.jl). 


##Installation
1. Install and build PIPS-NLP solver located [installation instruction](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/PIPS). Then set the environment variables `PIPS_NLP_PAR_SHARED_LIB` and `PIPS_NLP_SHARED_LIB` to the location of the PIPS-NLP parallel and serial shared (.so|.dylib) Libraries correspondingly. Note that the shared libraries are named `libparpipsnlp.so|.dylib` and `libpipsnlp.so|.dylib`.

2. Install Ipopt solver, if not already installed:

 `julia> Pkg.add("Ipopt")`

2. Install StructJuMPSolverInterface:
 
 `julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/StructJuMPSolverInterface.jl")`


##An example
```julia
using StructJuMP, JuMP

numScen = 2
m = StructuredModel(num_scenarios=numScen)
@variable(m, x[1:2])
@NLconstraint(m, x[1] + x[2] == 100)
@NLobjective(m, Min, x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[1]*x[2])

for i in 1:numScen
    bl = StructuredModel(parent=m, id=i)
    @variable(bl, y[1:2])
    @NLconstraint(bl, x[1] + y[1]+y[2] ≥  0)
    @NLconstraint(bl, x[2] + y[1]+y[2] ≤ 50)
    @NLobjective(bl, Min, y[1]^2 + y[2]^2 + y[1]*y[2])
end
```
The above example builds a two level structured model `m` with 2 scenarios. Then this model can be solved by calling `solve` function and specifying a solver that implements the StructJuMPSolverInterface. 
```julia
solve(m, solver="PipsNlp") #solving using parallel PIPS-NLP solver
solve(m, solver="PipsNlpSerial") #solving using serial PIPS-NLP solver, mostly for debug and maintenance purpose
solve(m, solver="Ipopt") #solving using (serial) Ipopt solver
```

## Known Limitation
* If a constraint declared at the sub-problem uses variable from the parent level, it has to be add using @NLconstraint (instead of @constraint).
